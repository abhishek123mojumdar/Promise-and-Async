# Promises

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/js-ab14ux)

Promises help us to deal with Asynchronous JavaScript
In this Project I have tried to cover how promises are written

1. It starts with mock implementaion of an Api using setTimeout
2. How to use an XHR object can an APi and use a promise to resolve it
3. Usage of fetch APi
4. Implementation of Promise.all
5. Promise.allSettlled is also done but is under comments
